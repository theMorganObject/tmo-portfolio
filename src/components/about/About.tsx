        As a self-taught developer, I built my first app 3 years ago and then
        put myself through my own custom bootcamp of complete courses. I have 6
        months' production experience as an independent contractor at a video
        streaming startup. I have an additional 5 years&apos; experience in
        non-profit leadership and enjoyed a career as a music teacher before I
        learned to code. I also hold an M.M. from the University of California,
        Los Angeles.

      <p>
        My natural affinity for complex patterns, passion for knowledge
        acquisition, and hunger for challenges led me to coding.
      </p>

        I have a passion for process, and I embrace the continuous improvement
        cycles that allow me to deliver transformative user experiences in
        ever-faster iterations. I am an advocate for digital solutions to
        real-world problems, and my ability to see the big picture and account
        for a wide user-base in terms of accessibility, culture, and design is
        one of my strong suits. I love working on teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I&apos;m not coding, I enjoy cycling, yoga, playing music, and
        cooking. My favorite subject is languages: whether it's a new paradigm
        or the next skill set I have to develop for a project. Outside of
        spending my time coding, I'm embracing the digital nomad lifestyle and
        learning to speak Korean.
