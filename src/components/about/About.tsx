        As a self-taught developer, I built my first app three years ago and
        committed to a rigorous self-designed program of study. With six months
        of production experience as an independent contractor at a video
        streaming startup, I have firsthand knowledge of building and deploying
        scalable solutions under pressure. My background also includes five
        years of non-profit leadership and a continuous career as a music
        teacher, where I honed my ability to learn, adapt, and lead by example.
        I hold an M.M. from the University of California, Los Angeles.

        I thrive in challenging environments, whether it&apos;s unraveling
        complex systems or finding innovative solutions to tough problems. For
        me, coding is not just a professionâ€”it&apos;s a craft that demands
        discipline, precision, and creative thinking. I approach every project
        with focus and determination, embracing the intricate complexity of this
        field as an opportunity to grow and deliver results.

      <p>
        I&apos;m passionate about refining processes and embracing continuous
        improvement. This focus allows me to deliver transformative user
        experiences through steady, efficient work. I see the big picture,
        keeping accessibility in mind and ensuring solutions that work for
        everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy cycling, yoga, playing music, cooking, and
        learning new languages.
