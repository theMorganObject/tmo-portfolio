    aboutText:
      'A video multi-streaming platform similar to Twitch, with unique features that empower users to be their own multi-stream live editors. As the Frontend Technical Lead, I led a team of 3 developers in a 6-month platform-wide refactor that improved page speed and performance by 89%. Throughout 12 sprint cycles, I collaborated with the Product Owner to implement new features such as monetization, channel analytics, and admin roles, while also addressing critical data-security vulnerabilities and improving code quality standards.',

I collaborated closely with backend engineers to optimize data fetching, consolidated duplicate components from the landing page into a single, reusable module, and worked alongside a designer to ensure the design aligned with the product manager's specifications. Additionally, I played a key role in unifying data naming conventions across the stack, enhancing maintainability and consistency.",

The project progressed from the initial design draft to the final mock-up, though it has yet to be connected to the back-end.",

      'This is a passion project for a dear friend of mine, who has written one poem a day since August 21st, 2020. It is still currently in development, however it has provided a number of very fun challenges along the way. The poems were originally written in .pages format. I utilized an open-source AppleScript to batch-convert 742 .pages files to .txt and then wrote several Python scripts to convert again to .md, adding custom metadata that was extracted dynamically.',
